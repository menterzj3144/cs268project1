            <h1>Client Critique</h1>
            <h3>Kate (Bass)</h3>
            <p>
                I think the website is very professional looking. I love the desktop home page when the logo fades in over the photo. Scrolling through each page, there is great continuity between each section of the page and the transitions when enlarging photos are very smooth. My main critique is that on the mobile version, the photo behind the logo is cut off so I can only see the band's feet (fixed). Other than that, I really love the end product!
            </p>

            <h3>Braedon (Drums)</h3>
            <p>
                This website is very aesthetically pleasing and looks professional, while also giving off the vibe that it belongs to a rock band. The tabs are easy to navigate, and each are informative on their subject. One suggestion I might have is to avoid some redundancy inside some paragraphs, such as in the about tab. You can start with removing "TTKH has an album titled Through The Kitchen Hole" and replace that with "TTKH has a self -titled album", which makes it feel less like a run on sentence. Also, rather than saying, "since the formation of the band in 2018", you could just say "is a founding member" and put the formation year in the general "About Through The Kitchen Hole" section at the top of the page. Also, keep the member tabs moderately consistent. Kate is missing her information on when she "joined" the band. I really like how the color scheme is kept throughout this website. I don't feel like a certain page doesn't fit with the entire website, it all blends together nicely. On the photo page, the slideshow at the top seems to only cycle through 3 or 4 photos. If your goal was to only showcase the photos of the band as a whole, you can leave it how it is, otherwise fix it so it shows each photo.

            <h3>Abby (Vocals)</h3>
            <p>
                I love the organization of the website. Right away it gives you the Facebook, instagram, and Spotify link. I like how the "about" page gives an introduction the the band as a whole and to each member. (Having transitions able to be played on the about page was cool. Gives a taste of our original work) 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I like how in the events section it has a link to our Facebook events. We just need to stay on top of making sure the Facebook events are accurate. We usually do that anyway. And of course, keeping this page up to date with new gigs is needed obviously. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The photos section is nice. We've got some good pictures I want more of the full band playing. Either we can't see the drummer or I'm out taking the pictures while Kate sings so it isn't the full band. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The contact section is nice. I'm wondering if it would be beneficial to have a the ttkh email also on that page. Or just the information that is on our card. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I noticed that the logo fades back in when you go from one section back to it. I reeeeally like that for some reason. It shows the picture in the back and then the logo fades in. I like that. 
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Overall I don't have much constructive criticism at all. It's super easy to use and find things in. It's not too busy, it's actually pretty classy. In a rock and roll kind of way.
            </p>

            <h3>Toby (Guitar)</h3>
            <p>
                The structure of the website is great with a solid theme that is consistent throughout, and easily navigable. There is plenty of content and it is all relevant to the subject, and everything fits in nicely. The social media links at the top are also a nice touch. There isn't anything major that I would change, but if I had to change something, I would make the photos larger when you click on them in the photos tab, and make the message box larger in the contact tab.
