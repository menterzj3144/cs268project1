                    Through The Kitchen Hole is a rock band based out of Eau Claire, WI. The band formed in early 2018 when a few friends decided to play in a school talent show. Since then, TTKH has grown both in size and talent. TTKH plays at many venues across the Chippewa Valley such as The Plus, Jake's Supper Club, and the Relay For Life. They also competed in the Rockonsin garage band competition at Summerfest in 2018, and the Bitter Jester Music Festival in 2019.
