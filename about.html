                <h1>About Through The Kitchen Hole</h1>
                <p>
                    Through The Kitchen Hole is a rock band based out of Eau Claire, WI. Currently comprised of four members, the band formed in early 2018 as a cover band, but has since begun adding their own original music to their repertoire. After releasing an original track alongside covers of four of their favorite songs in the summer of 2018, they wrote, recorded, and released <em>Snake Eyes</em> in August 2022. <em>Snake Eyes</em> is their first full length album of all original material.
